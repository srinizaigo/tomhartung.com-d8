### It would be nice to keep our images in git.
### Drupal insists on getting images from a subdirectory of sites/default/files
### But sites/default/files is full of files we do not want to keep in git.
### So I tried the following settings to try to get this to work the way I want,
###   but it didn't work.
### Note to self: Don't try this again, just remember (uhg) to copy the files by hand!
###
### !/sites/default
### /sites/default/files
### !/sites/default/files/idmygadget/*
